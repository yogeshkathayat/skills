# browse — Operational Guides

Read this file when you need the handoff protocol, optimization tips, or help choosing which command to use.

## Handoff Protocol (MANDATORY)

Read this section when you hit CAPTCHA, MFA, OAuth, or any blocker after 2-3 failed attempts. The server auto-suggests handoff after 3 consecutive failures (look for HINT in error messages).

When the browser hits a blocker you can't solve, you MUST follow this exact 3-step protocol. Do NOT skip any step.

### Step 1 — Ask permission (REQUIRED before handoff)

Use `AskUserQuestion` (or your platform's equivalent interactive prompt tool) to ask
the user before opening the browser. Do NOT just print text and proceed — you MUST
wait for an explicit response.

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "I'm stuck on a CAPTCHA at [URL]. Can I open a visible browser so you can solve it?"
  options:
    - label: "Yes, open browser"
      description: "Opens a visible Chrome window with your current session"
    - label: "No, try something else"
      description: "I'll try cookie-import, auth login, or a different approach"
```

If your platform does not have `AskUserQuestion`, ask the user via text and wait for
their response before proceeding. Do NOT run handoff without explicit user confirmation.

If the user says no, try `cookie-import`, `auth login`, or a different approach.

### Step 2 — Handoff + wait for user (REQUIRED)

Run the handoff command, then use `AskUserQuestion` (or equivalent) to wait for the
user to finish:

```bash
browse handoff "Stuck on CAPTCHA at login page"
```

Then immediately prompt the user:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Browser is open. Please solve the CAPTCHA, then click Done."
  options:
    - label: "Done"
      description: "I've solved it, return to headless mode"
    - label: "Cancel"
      description: "Close the browser, try something else"
```

Do NOT proceed or do any other work while waiting. The user is interacting with the
visible browser — wait for their response.

### Step 3 — Resume

After the user responds:

```bash
browse resume
# Returns fresh snapshot — continue working with it
```

If "Done" — continue with the fresh snapshot from resume.
If "Cancel" — resume anyway (closes headed browser), then try alternative approach.

### When to Handoff
- CAPTCHA or bot detection blocking progress
- Multi-factor authentication requiring a physical device
- OAuth popup that redirects to a third-party login
- Any blocker after 2-3 failed attempts at the same step
- The server auto-suggests handoff after 3 consecutive failures (look for HINT in error messages)

### When NOT to Handoff
- Normal navigation/interaction failures — retry or try a different selector
- Pages that just need more time to load — use `wait` commands
- Cookie/auth issues — try `cookie-import` or `auth login` first

### Handoff Rules
- NEVER run `browse handoff` without asking the user first (Step 1)
- NEVER proceed without waiting for the user to finish (Step 2)
- ALWAYS tell the user what they need to do in the visible browser
- ALWAYS run `browse resume` after the user is done

## Speed Rules

Read this section to optimize your command usage and minimize token consumption.

1. **Navigate once, query many times.** `goto` loads the page; then `text`, `js`, `css`, `screenshot` all run against the loaded page instantly.
2. **Use `snapshot -i` for interaction.** Get refs for all interactive elements, then click/fill by ref. No need to guess CSS selectors.
3. **Use `snapshot -C` for SPAs.** Catches cursor:pointer divs and onclick handlers that ARIA misses.
4. **Use `js` for precision.** `js "document.querySelector('.price').textContent"` is faster than parsing full page text.
5. **Use `links` to survey.** Faster than `text` when you just need navigation structure.
6. **Use `chain` for multi-step flows.** Avoids CLI overhead per step.
7. **Use `responsive` for layout checks.** One command = 3 viewport screenshots.
8. **Use `--session` for parallel work.** Multiple agents can browse simultaneously without interference.
9. **Use `value`/`count` instead of `js`.** Purpose-built commands are cleaner than `js "document.querySelector(...).value"`.
10. **Use `frame` for iframes.** Don't try to reach into iframes with CSS — use `frame [id=x]` first.

## Architecture

Read this section to understand the system design.

- Persistent Chromium daemon on localhost (port 9400-10400)
- Bearer token auth per session
- One server per project directory — `--session` handles agent isolation
- Session multiplexing: multiple agents share one Chromium via isolated BrowserContexts
- For separate servers: set `BROWSE_INSTANCE` env var (e.g., fault isolation between teams)
- `browse instances` — discover all running servers (PID, port, status, session count)
- Project-local state: `.browse/` directory at project root (auto-created, self-gitignored)
  - `sessions/{id}/` — per-session screenshots, logs, PDFs
  - `states/{name}.json` — saved browser state (cookies + localStorage)
  - `browse-server.json` — server PID, port, auth token
- Auto-shutdown when all sessions idle past 30 min
- Chromium crash — server exits — auto-restarts on next command
- AI-friendly error messages: Playwright errors rewritten to actionable hints
- CDP remote connection: `BROWSE_CDP_URL` to connect to existing Chrome
- Policy enforcement: `browse-policy.json` for allow/deny/confirm rules
- Two browser engines: playwright (default) and rebrowser (stealth, bypasses bot detection)
