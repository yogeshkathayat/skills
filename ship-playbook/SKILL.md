  Take one feature request and run the entire delivery playbook automatically: plan it, review the
  plan, build it task by task, review the build, and optionally audit it for launch — then return the
  verified findings as feedback (one pass, no autonomous loop; the user decides on any fix round). It
  chains the existing skills as one runnable Workflow:
  plan-to-task-list-with-dag (plan + assign a specialist agent per task) → plan-founder-review (loop
  to APPROVE) → a specialist engineer/reviewer build across the DAG → a full claude ∥ codex/kiro
  cross-review → go-live-audit. Up front it asks two things — which harness cross-reviews
  (claude / codex / kiro / none) and whether to run a go-live audit at the end — then executes every
  step end to end. Use when the user wants "prompt → planned, built, reviewed, audited" in one go
  instead of running each phase by hand.

  Use only when the user explicitly asks to run the full delivery playbook on a feature request —
  "ship this end to end", "run the playbook on <X>", "/ship-playbook build <X>", "plan, review,
  build and audit <X>". Do NOT use for a single phase: use plan-to-task-list-with-dag to only plan,
  plan-founder-review to only review a plan, go-live-audit to only audit, or the per-harness review
  skills to only cross-review. This skill spawns many agents over multiple rounds — it is
  explicit-user-only.
---

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
This skill drives a long-running, multi-agent delivery Workflow. Non-negotiable rules:
1. The Workflow runs ONE pass — plan → plan review → build → impl review → (audit) → verify — and
   RETURNS the verified findings as feedback. It does NOT loop on its own: a Workflow can't ask the
   user mid-run, and an autonomous fix-loop is what caused multi-hour grinds. When findings remain, the
   skill (Phase 3) presents them and the USER decides whether to run a fix round. The Workflow executes
   steps 3–14 as real phases; the skill performs steps 1, 2, 2.1 (the prompt + the intake questions)
   and feeds them in as `args`.
2. ALWAYS ask the intake questions first (plan-review harness + go-live audit, plus the optional
   end-of-run project-map refresh). The first two are Workflow inputs, not steps it can skip; the map
   refresh is a Phase-3 action the skill runs after the Workflow returns.
3. The BUILD is a Workflow phase, not a description. Per task across the DAG layers: the ENGINEER
   implements on a task branch in an isolated worktree, an in-workflow INTEGRATE agent git-merges it
   onto the working branch, the REVIEWER reviews the integrated state, and a bounded fix loop runs
   until the task passes. Engineer and reviewer default to the plan's matched specialist agents; when
   the user chose a build/review handoff they route to `codex` or `kiro` instead (`buildHarness` /
   `taskReviewHarness`).
4. The build picks the closest AVAILABLE specialist per task; it falls back to `general-purpose` ONLY
   with the user's consent after the skill notified them a specialist is missing — never silently. When
   a task's stack skill is installed, the engineer MUST use it (`/nextjs`, `/laravel`, `/rust`, …).
   (This applies to the native path; when the user handed building/reviewing to `codex` or `kiro`,
   those tasks route there instead.)
5. Gates are real. The founder-review loops review → FIX → re-review until APPROVE / no issues; the
   build loops engineer → reviewer → fix until the task passes. Never wave a gate through.
6. Codex delegation goes through the codex plugin (`codex:codex-rescue` agentType). Kiro via the
   kiro path. "claude" = native. "none" = skip the external cross-review. (See `harness-routing.md`.)
7. There is no autonomous recursion. After one pass, surface the verified findings honestly and let
   the user choose to run a fix round (re-invoke with the findings as the prompt) — NEVER fake a clean
   verdict, and never silently loop.
8. Keep this body focused on launching + reporting the Workflow. Load the build contract, harness
   routing, state machine, and the Workflow script itself from `references/`.

# Ship Playbook

## Inputs

- `$request`: The feature prompt — what to plan, build, review, and ship. May carry overrides like
  `harness=codex` or `golive=yes` to seed intake. For a fix round, pass the prior findings as the prompt.

## Goal

Turn one prompt into shipped-quality work the same way every time, by running the delivery playbook
as a single runnable Workflow: a grounded DAG plan, a plan that survives founder review
(native + an optional second harness, looped to APPROVE), an implementation built task-by-task with a
specialist engineer/reviewer pair across the DAG layers, a full implementation cross-review (the
plan-vs-implementation gate), and an optional go-live audit — then it RETURNS the verified findings as
feedback. It runs ONE pass and does not loop on its own; if findings remain, the user decides whether
to run a fix round.

The 14 steps map to the Workflow phases: **step 3 → Plan · steps 4–9 → Plan review (native ∥ selected
harness, one bounded loop) · steps 10–11 → Build · step 12 → Impl review (plan-vs-implementation) ·
step 14 → Verify (dedup + adversarial verify → feedback) · step 13 → Audit (only if build+impl
verified-clean)**. Steps 1, 2, 2.1 are the prompt and the questions the skill collects up front. There
is no automatic recursion — the workflow returns its findings and stops.

## Phase 1 — Intake (steps 1, 2, 2.1)

The prompt is `$request` (step 1). Ask the governing questions up front (in one or two
`AskUserQuestion` calls — the tool allows up to 4 questions each), unless `$request` already pins them:

1. **Plan/impl cross-review harness** (step 2) — which second harness cross-reviews the PLAN and the
   full implementation: `claude`, `codex`, `kiro`, or `none`. (This is the review cross-check; it is
   separate from who builds/reviews each task below.)
2. **Go-live audit at the end** (step 2.1) — `yes` adds the go-live audit after the build, `no` stops
   at the implementation review.
3. **Refresh the project map at the end** — whether to regenerate the `CLAUDE.md` context map after
   the build lands so it reflects the new code: `map-project` (single project),
   `map-project-monorepo` (workspace), or `no`. Detect the repo layout and offer the matching default
   (a workspace/monorepo → `map-project-monorepo`, otherwise `map-project`). Run only in Phase 3 on a
   real, non-aborted run.
4. **Build handoff** — who WRITES the code for each task: `native` (the plan's specialist engineer
   agents — default), `codex` (the codex plugin), or `kiro` (the Kiro CLI). Passed as `buildHarness`.
5. **Per-task review handoff** — who REVIEWS each task: `native` (the matched `-reviewer` agent —
   default), `codex`, or `kiro`. Passed as `taskReviewHarness`. Independent of #1 (which is the
   one-shot plan/impl cross-review) — this is the per-task reviewer in the build loop.

Then gather the project facts the Workflow needs (do not ask the user — read the repo): `root`
(absolute repo path), `workingBranch` (the current branch to build on — never build on a protected
branch without confirmation), `validate` (the workspace typecheck+lint+test command), and
`hardRules` (the load-bearing invariants from root `CLAUDE.md` / the spec).

**Verify `root` is a git work tree before launching** — `git -C <root> rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`
must print `true`, and `workingBranch` must exist with at least one commit. The build creates task
branches and git-merges them, so a non-git folder (or a repo with no commit on `workingBranch`) cannot
be built. If `root` is not a git repo, STOP and tell the user — offer `git init` + a baseline commit, or
correct the path — and do not launch the Workflow. (The Workflow runs the same preflight and aborts
cleanly with `ranReal:false`, but catching it here avoids spawning the run at all.)

**Resolve the specialist agents/skills this environment has, and notify on gaps.** The build assigns
an engineer + `-reviewer` agent per task and may require a stack skill (`/nextjs`, `/laravel`, `/rust`,
…) — these differ per install, and the plan agent (a subagent) cannot see the registry, so YOU resolve
them here and pass them down (this is why an unconstrained plan once invented a `nestjs-backend-engineer`
that wasn't installed):

1. From the agent types available to you (your Agent tool's `subagent_type` options) and your installed
   skills, list the specialist engineer/`-reviewer` agents and stack skills that actually exist here.
2. Identify the project's stack(s) and the specialists they'd want. If a needed specialist agent or
   stack skill is MISSING, NOTIFY the user with `AskUserQuestion` before building — name exactly what's
   missing and offer: **install it** (tell them how, then stop so they can re-run) or **continue
   without** (the build uses `general-purpose` for that agent and skips the missing stack skill).
3. Pass `availableAgents` (the specialist agent names that exist here, including their `-reviewer`
   forms) and `allowGeneralFallback` (`true` only if the user chose continue) into the Workflow `args`.
   The plan then assigns ONLY agents from that list, so it cannot invent one that isn't installed; the
   Workflow also returns `missingAgents` for anything that still slipped through.

Never silently substitute `general-purpose` for a missing specialist without telling the user first.

**Verify the chosen build/review handoff harness is installed, and notify if not.** If `buildHarness`
or `taskReviewHarness` is not `native`, confirm its tooling exists before launching:
- **kiro build** needs the `hand-over-to-kiro` skill (by Sabeur Thabti, @thabti) **and** `kiro-cli`
  (`kiro-cli --version`); **kiro review** needs the `kiro-review` skill **and** `kiro-cli`.
- **codex** (build or review) needs the codex plugin (`codex:codex-rescue`).

If a chosen handoff's tool is missing, NOTIFY the user with `AskUserQuestion` — offer to **install it**
(for kiro: `hand-over-to-kiro` via `npx skills add …` + kiro-cli from <https://kiro.dev/docs/cli>) or
**switch that handoff to `native`** (or another available harness). Do not silently fall back.

Open a master `TodoWrite` mirroring the phases in `references/playbook-state.md`.

**Success criteria**: `harness`, `goLive`, `mapRefresh`, `buildHarness`, `taskReviewHarness`, `root`
(a confirmed git work tree), `workingBranch`, `validate`, `hardRules`, and `availableAgents`
(+ `allowGeneralFallback` if any specialist is missing) are all resolved.

## Phase 2 — Run the playbook Workflow (steps 3–14)

If `goLive == yes`, FIRST author the go-live audit so step 13 composes the proven audit rather than a
thin pass: run the **`go-live-audit`** skill to generate the project-tailored audit workflow and
capture the `scriptPath` the Workflow tool persists for it; pass that path in as `auditScriptPath`.
(If you skip this, step 13 falls back to an inline finder pass.)

Then launch `references/workflow-template.js` via the **Workflow** tool, passing intake as `args`:

```
Workflow({ scriptPath: ".../references/workflow-template.js",
           args: { prompt, harness, goLive, root, workingBranch, validate, hardRules,
                   auditScriptPath, availableAgents, allowGeneralFallback,
                   buildHarness, taskReviewHarness } })
```

**Pass `args` as a real JSON object, NOT a JSON-encoded string.** A stringified blob reaches the
script as one string, fails its `typeof args === 'object'` check, and every input silently falls to a
`FILL:` placeholder. The script now hard-THROWS on that (and on a `harness` outside
`claude|codex|kiro|none`) instead of returning a fake `converged:true`, so a stringified-args launch
errors loudly — if you hit it, relaunch as a FRESH run (no resume) with `args` as an object.

The Workflow then executes the rest of the playbook, in order, as real phases — there is no step it
skips:

- **Plan (step 3)** — a planning agent follows the plan-to-task-list-with-dag methodology unattended
  (mode auto-selected), grounds every path in the real repo, assigns a specialist engineer +
  `-reviewer` + stack skill to each task, writes `.ulpi/plans/<name>.md`+`.json`, returns `{tasks, layers}`.
- **Plan review (steps 4–9)** — ONE bounded loop: native founder review (∥ the selected harness when
  `harness != none`) → fix the plan (JSON-first, re-render MD) → re-review. Exits as soon as no
  BLOCK/CONCERN remain (OBSERVATIONs never block) OR a fix round stops reducing the blocking count —
  capped at `MAX_REVIEW` (2).
- **Build (steps 10–11)** — walk the DAG layers; per task: engineer (worktree, task branch) →
  in-workflow integrate agent (`git merge` onto the working branch) → reviewer → bounded fix loop
  until it passes; barrier between layers. Engineer/reviewer = the native specialist by default, or
  `codex`/`kiro` per the `buildHarness`/`taskReviewHarness` handoff.
- **Impl review (step 12)** — full implementation review (plan vs implementation), native ∥ selected harness.
- **Verify (step 14)** — dedup + adversarially verify the build+impl findings. These become the
  returned `openRegister` — the feedback. No automatic re-plan/re-build; the workflow returns and stops.
- **Audit (step 13)** — runs only when build+impl are verified-clean: if `goLive`, COMPOSE the proven
  `go-live-audit` workflow inline via the `workflow()` hook (`auditScriptPath`) — gates → finders →
  dedup → dual-lens verify → critic — ∥ a selected-harness audit lane; its findings become `openRegister`.

Watch progress via `/workflows`. To iterate on the script, edit the saved `scriptPath` the tool
returns and re-invoke with `{scriptPath}` (and `resumeFromRunId` to reuse cached agent results).
**On any resume, re-pass the SAME `args` object** — `resumeFromRunId` reuses cached *agent* results but
the script re-executes from the top, so omitting `args` empties `CFG` and the script hard-throws on the
`FILL:` guard. Always include the full `args` object you launched with.

**Success criteria**: The Workflow runs to completion and returns
`{ converged, ranReal, plan, build, openRegister, missingAgents }`.

## Phase 3 — Report and escalate

Read the Workflow result:

- **First, confirm the run is real — not a false-clean.** If the result has `ranReal: false` (or an
  `aborted` message) or `harness` comes back as a `FILL:` string, the inputs never reached the script.
  Report that failure and relaunch (fresh run) with `args` as a real JSON object; do NOT treat
  `converged` as meaningful.
- **If `missingAgents` is non-empty**, some tasks ran on `general-purpose` because the assigned
  specialist isn't installed here. Surface the list (which agents, how to install) so the user can
  decide whether to install them and re-run for higher-quality output.
- **`converged: true`** (real run, `openRegister` empty) → DONE. Report the build outcome per task,
  the review/audit verdicts, and where the plan landed.
- **`openRegister` non-empty** → PRESENT the feedback and let the user decide. List the verified
  BLOCK/CONCERN findings (file:line, issue, suggested fix, which gate found them). Then offer the next
  move: **run a fix round** (re-invoke the workflow with the findings as the prompt — same intake),
  **hand-fix**, or **accept-with-risk**. The workflow does not loop on its own; never represent open
  findings as clean.

**Then, if the user chose a project-map refresh at intake AND the run was real (`ranReal`, not
aborted), run it last** — invoke the chosen skill (`map-project` or `map-project-monorepo`) so the
`CLAUDE.md` context map reflects the code the build just landed. Skip it on an aborted/false-clean run
(there's nothing new to map). This is the final step, after reporting.

**Success criteria**: Either the gates are genuinely clean, or the user is handed an honest list of
what still blocks, with the round budget respected; and the project map is refreshed if requested.

## Guardrails

- Do not run proactively; this is explicit-user-only (it spawns many agents across rounds).
- Round 1 runs the full cycle; recursion rounds are a fix loop (decompose → build → impl review) and
  deliberately skip founder plan review. Do not re-introduce plan review on recursion, and do not skip
  Impl review on any round — it is the plan-vs-implementation gate. The Workflow owns 3–14, the skill
  owns 1–2.1.
- Do not hand-roll the plan — the Workflow's plan phase follows the plan-to-task-list-with-dag
  methodology and assigns a specialist agent per task.
- The build assigns the closest AVAILABLE specialist per task; fall back to `general-purpose` only with
  the user's consent after notifying them a specialist is missing (never silently). When a stack skill
  is installed, the engineer MUST use it (`/nextjs`, `/laravel`, `/rust`, …).
- Never fabricate a clean verdict — open BLOCK/CONCERN findings are returned as feedback, not hidden.
- The workflow runs ONE pass and never loops on its own; a fix round is a deliberate user choice
  (re-invoke with the findings as the prompt). Do not re-introduce autonomous recursion.
- Do not pass secrets/tokens into any agent brief; reference by location, redact values.
- Do not build on a protected branch without explicit confirmation of `workingBranch`.
- Do not launch the build in a non-git folder or an empty repo — the build creates and merges task
  branches, so it requires a git work tree with a committed `workingBranch`.

## When To Load References

- `references/workflow-template.js`
  The runnable Workflow that executes the playbook in one pass (plan → bounded plan review →
  specialist build across DAG layers with in-workflow git integration → impl review → verify →
  go-live audit) and returns the verified findings. Launch it via the Workflow tool with the intake
  `args`; edit + re-run it to iterate.
- `references/build-loop.md`
  The build CONTRACT the build phase implements: MUST-pick-a-specialist pairing, per-stack skill
  enforcement, DAG layering + git integration, and the task-exit gate.
- `references/harness-routing.md`
  How `claude` / `codex` / `kiro` / `none` map to concrete invocations (the `codex:codex-rescue`
  plugin, kiro, native) for plan-review, code-review, and go-live-audit.
- `references/playbook-state.md`
  The single-pass state machine, master TodoWrite shape, finding schema + dedup, the Verify phase, and
  the clean-vs-feedback decision (fix rounds are user-driven, not automatic).

## Output Contract

Report:

1. intake — selected harness and go-live choice, resolved working branch
2. rounds run and convergence status
3. per-round plan name + build outcome per task (passed / fixes / blocked)
4. implementation review — native + harness findings (confirmed vs rejected)
5. go-live audit — verdict and blockers (or "skipped")
6. final state — clean, or the honest remaining-findings list with the round budget status
