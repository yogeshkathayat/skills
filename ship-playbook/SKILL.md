description: |
  Take one feature request and run the entire delivery playbook automatically: plan it, review the
  plan, build it task by task, review the build, and optionally audit it for launch — then return the
  verified findings as feedback (one pass, no autonomous loop; the user decides on any fix round). It
  chains the existing skills as one runnable Workflow:
  plan-to-task-list-with-dag (plan + assign a specialist agent per task) → plan-founder-review →
  a specialist engineer/reviewer build across the DAG → a full claude ∥ codex/kiro cross-review →
  go-live-audit. Up front it shows what skills/agents would help (with install commands), then asks
  which gates to run and at what depth — code writing and each review independently pick native / codex
  / kiro (reviews can skip; writer and reviewer can differ), so the user controls quality vs token cost.
  Use when the user wants "prompt → planned, built, reviewed, audited" in one go
  instead of running each phase by hand.

  Use only when the user explicitly asks to run the full delivery playbook on a feature request —
  "ship this end to end", "run the playbook on <X>", "/ship-playbook build <X>", "plan, review,
  build and audit <X>". Do NOT use for a single phase: use plan-to-task-list-with-dag to only plan,
  plan-founder-review to only review a plan, go-live-audit to only audit, or the per-harness review
  skills to only cross-review. This skill spawns many agents over multiple rounds — it is
  explicit-user-only.
---

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
This skill drives a long-running, multi-agent delivery Workflow. Non-negotiable rules:
1. The Workflow runs ONE pass — plan → plan review → build → impl review → (audit) → verify — and
   RETURNS the verified findings as feedback. It does NOT loop on its own: a Workflow can't ask the
   user mid-run, and an autonomous fix-loop is what caused multi-hour grinds. When findings remain, the
   skill (Phase 3) presents them and the USER decides whether to run a fix round. The Workflow executes
   steps 3–14 as real phases; the skill does the intake (dependency check + prompt + gate questions)
   and feeds the choices in as `args`.
2. Intake order is FIXED: (1) dependency check + continue/restart, then (2) the SEVEN gate questions —
   who writes the plan, who reviews the plan, who writes the code, who reviews the code, impl review,
   go-live audit, map project — then (3) scope grounding + facts. ALWAYS ask the seven gate questions
   FIRST, right after the dependency check. NEVER precede them with scope/feature-clarification
   questions ("full platform or just the API?", "which protocol?") — the prompt is the scope; ground it
   in step 3 or let the plan phase challenge it. Honor the gate choices: full rigor or skip both valid.
3. The BUILD is a Workflow phase, not a description. Per task across the DAG layers: the ENGINEER
   implements on a task branch in an isolated worktree, an in-workflow INTEGRATE agent git-merges it
   onto the working branch AND removes each merged worktree, the REVIEWER reviews the integrated state
   (unless `taskReview skip`), and a bounded fix loop runs until the task passes. Engineer routes per
   `buildHarness` and reviewer per `taskReview` — INDEPENDENTLY (each ∈ native / `codex` / `kiro`; the
   writer and reviewer may be different harnesses).
4. The build picks the closest AVAILABLE specialist per task; it falls back to `general-purpose` ONLY
   with the user's consent after the skill notified them a specialist is missing — never silently. When
   a task's stack skill is installed, the engineer MUST use it (`/nextjs`, `/laravel`, `/rust`, …).
   (This applies to the native path; when the user handed building/reviewing to `codex` or `kiro`,
   those tasks route there instead.)
5. Gates that ARE enabled are real — never wave one through or fake a clean verdict to exit. But the
   user controls WHICH gates run: a skipped gate (`planReview skip`, `taskReview skip`, `implReview
   skip`, `goLive no`) is a deliberate choice, not a gate to sneak back in. Warn (don't block) when
   both per-task and impl review are off — nothing checks the build then.
6. There is NO global harness — every role (code writing, plan review, per-task review, impl review)
   independently picks its own executor: `native` (claude / the plan's specialist agent), `codex` (the
   `codex:codex-rescue` plugin), or `kiro` (the kiro path; reviews via `kiro-review`, builds via
   `hand-over-to-kiro`). Writer and reviewers are independent. (See `harness-routing.md`.)
7. There is no autonomous recursion. After one pass, surface the verified findings honestly and let
   the user choose to run a fix round (re-invoke with the findings as the prompt) — NEVER fake a clean
   verdict, and never silently loop.
8. Keep this body focused on launching + reporting the Workflow. Load the build contract, harness
   routing, state machine, and the Workflow script itself from `references/`.

# Ship Playbook

## Inputs

- `$request`: The feature prompt — what to plan, build, review, and ship. May carry overrides like
  `harness=codex` or `golive=yes` to seed intake. For a fix round, pass the prior findings as the prompt.

## Goal

Turn one prompt into shipped-quality work the same way every time, by running the delivery playbook
as a single runnable Workflow: a grounded DAG plan, an optional founder plan review, an implementation
built task-by-task across the DAG layers (each task written and reviewed by the executor the user
chose), an optional plan-vs-implementation review, and an optional go-live audit — then it RETURNS the
verified findings as feedback. It runs ONE pass and does not loop on its own; if findings remain, the
user decides whether to run a fix round.

The 14 steps map to the Workflow phases: **step 3 → Plan · steps 4–9 → Plan review (optional, bounded
loop) · steps 10–11 → Build (per-task review optional) · step 12 → Impl review (optional,
plan-vs-implementation) · step 14 → Verify (dedup + adversarial verify → feedback) · step 13 → Audit
(only if `goLive` AND build+impl verified-clean)**. The skill does the intake (dependency check + prompt
+ gate questions) up front. Each review gate runs at the depth the user chose (skip / native / codex /
kiro); there is no automatic recursion — the workflow returns its findings and stops.

## Phase 1 — Intake

### Step 1 — Dependency check & setup (do this FIRST)

Before anything else, tell the user what would make this skill do its BEST work, what's already here,
and what's missing — with copy-paste install commands. ship-playbook composes other skills and routes
to specialist agents; the more of these are installed, the better the result.

**How to detect what's installed — use the loaded lists, NOT the disk.** A skill is "present" if it is
in YOUR available-skills list (the skills you can actually invoke this session); an agent is "present"
if it is in your Agent tool's `subagent_type` options. Those loaded lists are the source of truth.
**Do NOT shell out to `find`/`ls` to detect skills or agents** — they're commonly registered as
*symlinks* into a shared store (e.g. `.claude/skills/map-project → ../../.agents/skills/map-project`),
so `find -type d` silently misses them and the install root varies; that produces false "missing"
reports for skills that are clearly installed. Disk/PATH checks are ONLY for external CLIs (`kiro-cli` —
see below). Sanity check: if your method reports an obviously-present skill (like one you just used) as
missing, the method is broken — trust the loaded list, not the shell.

Detect the project's stack(s), then check (against those loaded lists) what's present vs missing across:

- **Composed skills** — `plan-to-task-list-with-dag`, `plan-founder-review`, `go-live-audit`,
  `map-project` / `map-project-monorepo`.
- **Specialist agents for this stack** — the `*-senior-engineer` + `*-reviewer` pairs the build would
  assign (e.g. `nextjs-senior-engineer`(+`-reviewer`), `laravel-senior-engineer`, `rust-senior-engineer`,
  …). Missing ones force `general-purpose`, which is lower quality.
- **Stack skills** — `/nextjs`, `/laravel`, `/rust`, … for the detected stack.
- **Optional harness tooling** (only if the user might pick codex/kiro): the **codex** plugin
  (`codex:codex-rescue`); for **kiro**, the CLI plus the `kiro-review` skill (reviewing) and
  `hand-over-to-kiro` skill (building). **Detecting the kiro CLI — two gotchas:**
  - The binary is named **`kiro-cli`, NOT `kiro`** (bare `kiro` is usually the Kiro IDE symlink, not the
    CLI). Check `kiro-cli`.
  - It's commonly in `~/.local/bin`, which the sandboxed Bash PATH may NOT include — so `command -v
    kiro-cli` can come back empty even when it's installed. Detect with a location-tolerant check, e.g.
    `command -v kiro-cli || ls ~/.local/bin/kiro-cli ~/.kiro/bin/kiro-cli /usr/local/bin/kiro-cli 2>/dev/null`,
    and confirm it runs (`kiro-cli --version`). Docs: <https://kiro.dev/docs/cli>.

Present **TWO separate tables**, each listing ONLY the MISSING items (do NOT list what's already
installed), with the **full, copy-paste install command** per row (never an abbreviation):

- **Missing skills** — `npx skills add https://github.com/ulpi-io/skills --skill <name>` (complete
  command per row). Covers the composed skills, stack skills, and the kiro helper skills
  (`kiro-review`, `hand-over-to-kiro`). `kiro-cli` itself (if missing) goes here too as a note with its
  docs link <https://kiro.dev/docs/cli>.
- **Missing agents** — `npx agentshq add ulpi-io/agents@<agent-name>` (complete command per row).
  Covers the stack's `*-senior-engineer` + `*-reviewer` specialists.

If a table has no missing items, omit it (or say "all present" in one line). Then **offer two choices**
with `AskUserQuestion`:

- **Continue now** with what's installed (missing specialists fall back to `general-purpose`; missing
  harness options simply won't be offered).
- **I'll install them — restart** : the user installs the listed items, then RESTARTS Claude (newly
  installed skills/agents are only loaded at startup) and re-runs `/ship-playbook`. Tell them to come
  back and re-invoke after restarting.

Record what's available — it feeds `availableAgents` and constrains which intake options you offer.

### Step 2 — The workflow gate questions (ask these FIRST)

The prompt is `$request`. Ask the SEVEN gate questions (across two `AskUserQuestion` calls — up to 4
each), in EXECUTION order so they read like the run, unless `$request` already pins them.

**These gate questions come FIRST — immediately after the dependency check (Step 1).** Do NOT precede
them with scope/feature-clarification questions ("full platform or just the API?", "which SSO
protocol?", etc.). The prompt IS the scope; if it's broad or ambiguous, you ground it in Step 3 (AFTER
these gates) or let the plan phase challenge scope during planning — never with a question round before
the gates. The user expects the workflow configuration first.

**Every role independently picks its executor** (each write and each review is separate — write with
codex, review with kiro is fine). Only offer `codex`/`kiro` for roles whose tooling Step 1 found
installed. Defaults are LIGHT to control token cost; the user can dial each up to full rigor or skip.

**Option ordering rule:** list `native` first (mark it Recommended/default), then `codex`, then
`kiro`, and put **`skip` as the LAST option you provide** (it then renders second-to-last, right before
the auto-added "Other"). Plan writing and code writing are NOT skippable (they must happen); the four
optional gates (plan review, code review, impl review, go-live audit, map) each include `skip`.

1. **Who WRITES the plan** — the DAG decomposition: `native` (plan-to-task-list-with-dag — default),
   `codex`, or `kiro`. Passed as `planHarness`. (No skip — the plan must be written.)
2. **Who REVIEWS the plan** — founder review (scope, decomposition, phantom paths): `native` (default),
   `codex`, `kiro`, or `skip`. Passed as `planReview`.
3. **Who WRITES the code** — every task + its fixes: `native` (the plan's specialist engineer agents —
   default), `codex`, or `kiro`. Passed as `buildHarness`. (No skip.)
4. **Who REVIEWS the code** — each built task in the build loop: `native` (the matched `-reviewer` —
   default), `codex`, `kiro`, or `skip` (no per-task reviewer or fix loop — biggest token save). Passed
   as `taskReview`.
5. **Implementation review after all tasks** — the plan-vs-implementation review: `native` (default),
   `codex`, `kiro`, or `skip`. Passed as `implReview`.
6. **Run the go-live audit** — `run` (the go-live audit, only fires if build+impl come back
   verified-clean) or `skip` (default). Passed as `goLive` (run → true).
7. **Run map-project at the end** — `map-project`, `map-project-monorepo`, or `skip` (default). Detect
   the repo layout and recommend the matching variant. Held as `mapRefresh` — this is NOT a Workflow arg
   (it isn't in the `args` object); the SKILL runs the chosen map skill itself in Phase 3, after the
   Workflow returns, on a real (non-aborted) run.

**Defaults** (light, kept safe): `planHarness native`, `planReview native`, `buildHarness native`,
`taskReview native`, `implReview native`, `goLive skip`, map `skip`. The user can go **full swing**
(every review on, codex/kiro where wanted, go-live on), **delegate writing and reviewing to harnesses**
(any write/review role → codex|kiro — and the writer and reviewer may be DIFFERENT harnesses), or go
fast (skip the reviews). **Warn (do not block)** if BOTH `taskReview skip` AND `implReview skip`:
nothing then checks the build, so a clean verdict only means the engineer validates passed.

### Step 3 — Scope grounding, project facts, git preflight, agent list

**Now (AFTER the gate questions) ground the scope.** Read the repo to understand what exists. If
`$request` is broad or ambiguous (e.g. "a self-hostable SaaS platform with SSO"), narrow it HERE: prefer
inferring scope from the repo, and only ask focused scope questions if you genuinely cannot proceed —
or pass the broad prompt through and let the plan phase challenge scope. Fold the resolved scope into
the `prompt` you pass in `args`.

Gather the facts the Workflow needs (do not ask the user — read the repo): `root` (absolute repo path),
`workingBranch` (never build on a protected branch without confirmation), `validate` (the workspace
typecheck+lint+test command), and `hardRules` (the load-bearing invariants from root `CLAUDE.md` / the spec).

**Verify `root` is a git work tree** — `git -C <root> rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` must print `true`,
and `workingBranch` must exist with at least one commit. The build creates and merges task branches, so
a non-git folder (or a branch with no commit) cannot be built. If `root` is not a git repo, STOP and
tell the user — offer `git init` + a baseline commit, or correct the path — and do not launch.

Pass `availableAgents` (the specialist engineer + `-reviewer` names that exist here, from Step 1) and
`allowGeneralFallback` (`true` only if the user chose Continue with gaps) into the Workflow `args`. The
plan then assigns ONLY agents from that list (it can't invent one that isn't installed); the Workflow
returns `missingAgents` for anything that still slips through. Never silently substitute
`general-purpose` for a missing specialist without the user having seen the gap in Step 1.

Open a master `TodoWrite` mirroring the phases in `references/playbook-state.md`.

**Success criteria**: dependency status was shown and the user chose continue-or-restart;
`planHarness`, `planReview`, `buildHarness`, `taskReview`, `implReview`, `goLive`, `mapRefresh`, `root`
(a confirmed git work tree), `workingBranch`, `validate`, `hardRules`, and `availableAgents`
(+ `allowGeneralFallback` if gaps) are all resolved.

## Phase 2 — Run the playbook Workflow (steps 3–14)

If `goLive == yes`, FIRST author the go-live audit so step 13 composes the proven audit rather than a
thin pass: run the **`go-live-audit`** skill to generate the project-tailored audit workflow and
capture the `scriptPath` the Workflow tool persists for it; pass that path in as `auditScriptPath`.
(If you skip this, step 13 falls back to an inline finder pass.)

Then launch `references/workflow-template.js` via the **Workflow** tool, passing intake as `args`:

```
Workflow({ scriptPath: ".../references/workflow-template.js",
           args: { prompt, root, workingBranch, validate, hardRules, goLive,
                   planHarness, planReview, buildHarness, taskReview, implReview,
                   auditScriptPath, availableAgents, allowGeneralFallback } })
```

`mapRefresh` is deliberately NOT in `args` — it's the only intake answer the Workflow doesn't run.
The map refresh regenerates `CLAUDE.md` from the FINISHED code, so the skill runs it itself in Phase 3
after the Workflow returns (see Q7). All other gate answers go in `args` above.

**Pass `args` as a real JSON object, NOT a JSON-encoded string.** A stringified blob reaches the
script as one string, fails its `typeof args === 'object'` check, and every input silently falls to a
`FILL:` placeholder. The script hard-THROWS on that instead of returning a fake `converged:true`, so a
stringified-args launch errors loudly — if you hit it, relaunch as a FRESH run (no resume) with `args`
as an object. (Each role arg coerces to a safe default if invalid, so a typo degrades gracefully.)

The Workflow then executes the playbook in one pass, running each gate at the level the user chose:

- **Plan (step 3)** — the planner (per `planHarness`: native / codex / kiro) follows the
  plan-to-task-list-with-dag methodology unattended (mode auto-selected), grounds every path in the
  real repo, assigns a specialist engineer + `-reviewer` + stack skill to each task, writes
  `.ulpi/plans/<name>.md`+`.json`, returns `{tasks, layers}`.
- **Plan review (steps 4–9)** — reviewer per `planReview` (`skip` / `native` / `codex` / `kiro`). ONE
  bounded loop → fix the plan (JSON-first, re-render MD; fix is always native) → re-review; exits on no
  BLOCK/CONCERN (OBSERVATIONs never block) OR non-convergence, capped at `MAX_REVIEW` (2).
- **Build (steps 10–11)** — walk the DAG layers; per task: engineer (worktree, task branch) →
  in-workflow integrate agent (`git merge` onto the working branch, removing each merged worktree as it
  goes) → reviewer (unless `taskReview skip`) → bounded fix loop until it passes; barrier between layers.
  Engineer routes per `buildHarness`; reviewer per `taskReview` — and the two are INDEPENDENT (write
  codex, review kiro is fine).
- **Impl review (step 12)** — reviewer per `implReview` (`skip` / `native` / `codex` / `kiro`). The
  plan-vs-implementation review of everything built.
- **Verify (step 14)** — dedup + adversarially verify the build+impl findings. These become the
  returned `openRegister` — the feedback. No automatic re-plan/re-build; the workflow returns and stops.
- **Audit (step 13)** — runs only when `goLive` AND build+impl come back verified-clean: COMPOSE the
  proven `go-live-audit` workflow inline via the `workflow()` hook (`auditScriptPath`) — gates →
  finders → dedup → dual-lens verify → critic — ∥ a second-harness audit lane; its findings become
  `openRegister`.

Watch progress via `/workflows`. To iterate on the script, edit the saved `scriptPath` the tool
returns and re-invoke with `{scriptPath}` (and `resumeFromRunId` to reuse cached agent results).
**On any resume, re-pass the SAME `args` object** — `resumeFromRunId` reuses cached *agent* results but
the script re-executes from the top, so omitting `args` empties `CFG` and the script hard-throws on the
`FILL:` guard. Always include the full `args` object you launched with.

**Success criteria**: The Workflow runs to completion and returns
`{ converged, ranReal, plan, build, openRegister, missingAgents, reviewConfig, noReviewGate }`.

## Phase 3 — Report and escalate

Read the Workflow result:

- **First, confirm the run is real — not a false-clean.** If the result has `ranReal: false` (or an
  `aborted` message), the inputs never reached the script (or a preflight failed). Report that failure
  and relaunch (fresh run) with `args` as a real JSON object; do NOT treat `converged` as meaningful.
- **If `missingAgents` is non-empty**, some tasks ran on `general-purpose` because the assigned
  specialist isn't installed here. Surface the list (which agents, how to install) so the user can
  decide whether to install them and re-run for higher-quality output.
- **If `noReviewGate: true`** (the user skipped BOTH per-task review and impl review), CAVEAT any
  clean verdict: it only means the engineer validates passed, nothing reviewed the build. Report
  `reviewConfig` so the user sees which gates ran.
- **`converged: true`** (real run, `openRegister` empty) → DONE. Report the build outcome per task,
  the review/audit verdicts (per `reviewConfig`), and where the plan landed.
- **`openRegister` non-empty** → PRESENT the feedback and let the user decide. List the verified
  BLOCK/CONCERN findings (file:line, issue, suggested fix, which gate found them). Then offer the next
  move: **run a fix round** (re-invoke the workflow with the findings as the prompt — same intake),
  **hand-fix**, or **accept-with-risk**. The workflow does not loop on its own; never represent open
  findings as clean.

**Then, if the user chose a project-map refresh at intake AND the run was real (`ranReal`, not
aborted), run it last** — invoke the chosen skill (`map-project` or `map-project-monorepo`) so the
`CLAUDE.md` context map reflects the code the build just landed. Skip it on an aborted/false-clean run
(there's nothing new to map). This is the final step, after reporting.

**Success criteria**: Either the enabled gates are genuinely clean (caveated by `reviewConfig` /
`noReviewGate`), or the user is handed an honest list of what still blocks plus next moves; and the
project map is refreshed if requested.

## Guardrails

- Do not run proactively; this is explicit-user-only (it spawns many agents across rounds).
- The workflow runs ONE pass and never loops on its own; a fix round is a deliberate user choice
  (re-invoke with the findings as the prompt). Review gates are user-selected per run — honor the
  user's `planReview`/`taskReview`/`implReview` choices, and warn (don't block) when both per-task and
  impl review are skipped. The Workflow owns steps 3–14; the skill owns intake (dependency check +
  questions) and the Phase-3 report.
- Do not hand-roll the plan — the Workflow's plan phase follows the plan-to-task-list-with-dag
  methodology and assigns a specialist agent per task.
- The build assigns the closest AVAILABLE specialist per task; fall back to `general-purpose` only with
  the user's consent after notifying them a specialist is missing (never silently). When a stack skill
  is installed, the engineer MUST use it (`/nextjs`, `/laravel`, `/rust`, …).
- Never fabricate a clean verdict — open BLOCK/CONCERN findings are returned as feedback, not hidden.
- The workflow runs ONE pass and never loops on its own; a fix round is a deliberate user choice
  (re-invoke with the findings as the prompt). Do not re-introduce autonomous recursion.
- Do not pass secrets/tokens into any agent brief; reference by location, redact values.
- Do not build on a protected branch without explicit confirmation of `workingBranch`.
- Do not launch the build in a non-git folder or an empty repo — the build creates and merges task
  branches, so it requires a git work tree with a committed `workingBranch`.
- Keep build worktrees from poisoning the gate: the workflow prunes its `.claude/worktrees/` build
  checkouts (at preflight, after each integrate, and at end), and the integrate validate must never
  scan `.claude/worktrees/**` or sibling agent dirs. If a run's gate fails on files outside the task's
  scope, suspect leftover worktrees before suspecting the code.

## When To Load References

- `references/workflow-template.js`
  The runnable Workflow that executes the playbook in one pass (plan → bounded plan review →
  specialist build across DAG layers with in-workflow git integration → impl review → verify →
  go-live audit) and returns the verified findings. Launch it via the Workflow tool with the intake
  `args`; edit + re-run it to iterate.
- `references/build-loop.md`
  The build CONTRACT the build phase implements: MUST-pick-a-specialist pairing, per-stack skill
  enforcement, DAG layering + git integration, and the task-exit gate.
- `references/harness-routing.md`
  How `claude` / `codex` / `kiro` / `none` map to concrete invocations (the `codex:codex-rescue`
  plugin, kiro, native) for plan-review, code-review, and go-live-audit.
- `references/playbook-state.md`
  The single-pass state machine, master TodoWrite shape, finding schema + dedup, the Verify phase, and
  the clean-vs-feedback decision (fix rounds are user-driven, not automatic).

## Output Contract

Report:

1. intake — the review config used (`reviewConfig`: harness + which gates ran at what depth), go-live
   choice, resolved working branch
2. plan name + build outcome per task (passed / fixes / blocked)
3. plan review and implementation review — findings by enabled gate (confirmed vs rejected), or "skipped"
4. go-live audit — verdict and blockers (or "skipped")
5. final state — clean (caveated if `noReviewGate`), or the honest remaining-findings list + next moves
