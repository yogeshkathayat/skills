  Structural code search via AST patterns. Find code by structure, not text — async functions
  without error handling, specific API call patterns, missing guards. Use when grep/ripgrep
  can't express what you need. Requires ast-grep CLI.

  - Bash
  - Read
  - Write
---

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
Before writing ANY ast-grep rule, you **ABSOLUTELY MUST**:

1. Create example code that represents what you want to match
2. Use `--debug-query=cst` to understand the actual AST structure
3. Always add `stopBy: end` to relational rules (inside/has)
4. Test the rule against example code BEFORE searching the codebase
5. Escape metavariables in shell commands (\$VAR or use single quotes)

**Writing rules without testing = false negatives, missed matches, wasted time**

This is not optional. Every ast-grep search requires disciplined verification.

# ast-grep Code Search

## MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE PROTOCOL

Before writing ANY ast-grep rule, you **MUST** complete this checklist:

1. ☐ **Verify ast-grep is installed** (run `ast-grep --version`)
2. ☐ **If not installed, provide installation instructions and STOP**
3. ☐ Clarify what the user wants to find (pattern, language, edge cases)
4. ☐ Create example code snippet representing the target pattern
5. ☐ Use `--debug-query=cst` to inspect the AST structure
6. ☐ Identify the correct `kind` values for target nodes
7. ☐ Write the simplest rule that could work (pattern first)
8. ☐ Add `stopBy: end` to any relational rules (inside/has)
9. ☐ Test rule against example code with `--stdin`
10. ☐ Announce: "Searching for [pattern description] using [rule type]"

**Writing ast-grep rules WITHOUT completing this checklist = missed matches.**

## Overview

This skill helps translate natural language queries into ast-grep rules for structural code search. ast-grep uses Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) patterns to match code based on its structure rather than just text, enabling powerful and precise code search across large codebases.

## Prerequisites Check

**CRITICAL: Before proceeding with any ast-grep search, verify ast-grep is installed.**

Check if ast-grep is available:

```bash
ast-grep --version
```

**If ast-grep is NOT installed:**

1. Inform the user: "ast-grep is not installed. Would you like installation instructions?"
2. If user confirms, provide installation instructions:

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install ast-grep
```

**Linux (Cargo):**
```bash
cargo install ast-grep
```

**npm (all platforms):**
```bash
npm install -g @ast-grep/cli
```

**Manual installation:**
```bash
# Download from GitHub releases
# https://github.com/ast-grep/ast-grep/releases
```

3. After installation, verify with `ast-grep --version`
4. Only proceed with ast-grep search after installation is confirmed

**Do NOT attempt to run ast-grep commands if it's not installed.**

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when users:
- Need to search for code patterns using structural matching (e.g., "find all async functions that don't have error handling")
- Want to locate specific language constructs (e.g., "find all function calls with specific parameters")
- Request searches that require understanding code structure rather than just text
- Ask to search for code with particular AST characteristics
- Need to perform complex code queries that traditional text search cannot handle

## General Workflow

Follow this process to help users write effective ast-grep rules:

### Step 0: Verify Installation (MANDATORY)

**Gate: ast-grep installed and verified before proceeding to Step 1.**

Before doing anything else, check if ast-grep is installed:

```bash
ast-grep --version
```

**If NOT installed:**
1. Stop immediately
2. Inform the user that ast-grep is required
3. Provide installation instructions (see Prerequisites Check section above)
4. Do NOT proceed until user confirms installation

**If installed:**
- Note the version for reference
- Proceed to Step 1

### Step 1: Understand the Query

**Gate: Pattern and language clarified before proceeding to Step 2.**

Clearly understand what the user wants to find. Ask clarifying questions if needed:
- What specific code pattern or structure are they looking for?
- Which programming language?
- Are there specific edge cases or variations to consider?
- What should be included or excluded from matches?

### Step 2: Create Example Code

**Gate: Example code saved to temp file before proceeding to Step 3.**

Write a simple code snippet that represents what the user wants to match. Save this to a temporary file for testing.

**Example:**
If searching for "async functions that use await", create a test file:

```javascript
// test_example.js
async function example() {
  const result = await fetchData();
  return result;
}
```

### Step 3: Write the ast-grep Rule

**Gate: Rule compiles without errors before proceeding to Step 4.**

Translate the pattern into an ast-grep rule. Start simple and add complexity as needed.

**Key principles:**
- Always use `stopBy: end` for relational rules (`inside`, `has`) to ensure search goes to the end of the direction
- Use `pattern` for simple structures
- Use `kind` with `has`/`inside` for complex structures
- Break complex queries into smaller sub-rules using `all`, `any`, or `not`

**Example rule file (test_rule.yml):**
```yaml
id: async-with-await
language: javascript
rule:
  kind: function_declaration
  has:
    pattern: await $EXPR
    stopBy: end
```

See `references/rule_reference.md` for comprehensive rule documentation.

### Step 4: Test the Rule

**Gate: Rule matches example code correctly before proceeding to Step 5.**

Use ast-grep CLI to verify the rule matches the example code. There are two main approaches:

**Option A: Test with inline rules (for quick iterations)**
```bash
echo "async function test() { await fetch(); }" | ast-grep scan --inline-rules "id: test
language: javascript
rule:
  kind: function_declaration
  has:
    pattern: await \$EXPR
    stopBy: end" --stdin
```

**Option B: Test with rule files (recommended for complex rules)**
```bash
ast-grep scan --rule test_rule.yml test_example.js
```

**Debugging if no matches:**
1. Simplify the rule (remove sub-rules)
2. Add `stopBy: end` to relational rules if not present
3. Use `--debug-query` to understand the AST structure (see below)
4. Check if `kind` values are correct for the language

### Step 5: Search the Codebase

**Gate: Results returned and reviewed before proceeding to Step 6.**

Once the rule matches the example code correctly, search the actual codebase:

**For simple pattern searches:**
```bash
ast-grep run --pattern 'console.log($ARG)' --lang javascript /path/to/project
```

**For complex rule-based searches:**
```bash
ast-grep scan --rule my_rule.yml /path/to/project
```

**For inline rules (without creating files):**
```bash
ast-grep scan --inline-rules "id: my-rule
language: javascript
rule:
  pattern: \$PATTERN" /path/to/project
```

## ast-grep CLI Commands

### Inspect Code Structure (--debug-query)

Dump the AST structure to understand how code is parsed:

```bash
ast-grep run --pattern 'async function example() { await fetch(); }' \
  --lang javascript \
  --debug-query=cst
```

**Available formats:**
- `cst`: Concrete Syntax Tree (shows all nodes including punctuation)
- `ast`: Abstract Syntax Tree (shows only named nodes)
- `pattern`: Shows how ast-grep interprets your pattern

**Use this to:**
- Find the correct `kind` values for nodes
- Understand the structure of code you want to match
- Debug why patterns aren't matching

**Example:**
```bash
# See the structure of your target code
ast-grep run --pattern 'class User { constructor() {} }' \
  --lang javascript \
  --debug-query=cst

# See how ast-grep interprets your pattern
ast-grep run --pattern 'class $NAME { $$$BODY }' \
  --lang javascript \
  --debug-query=pattern
```

### Test Rules (scan with --stdin)

Test a rule against code snippet without creating files:

```bash
echo "const x = await fetch();" | ast-grep scan --inline-rules "id: test
language: javascript
rule:
  pattern: await \$EXPR" --stdin
```

**Add --json for structured output:**
```bash
echo "const x = await fetch();" | ast-grep scan --inline-rules "..." --stdin --json
```

### Search with Patterns (run)

Simple pattern-based search for single AST node matches:

```bash
# Basic pattern search
ast-grep run --pattern 'console.log($ARG)' --lang javascript .

# Search specific files
ast-grep run --pattern 'class $NAME' --lang python /path/to/project

# JSON output for programmatic use
ast-grep run --pattern 'function $NAME($$$)' --lang javascript --json .
```

**When to use:**
- Simple, single-node matches
- Quick searches without complex logic
- When you don't need relational rules (inside/has)

### Search with Rules (scan)

YAML rule-based search for complex structural queries:

```bash
# With rule file
ast-grep scan --rule my_rule.yml /path/to/project

# With inline rules
ast-grep scan --inline-rules "id: find-async
language: javascript
rule:
  kind: function_declaration
  has:
    pattern: await \$EXPR
    stopBy: end" /path/to/project

# JSON output
ast-grep scan --rule my_rule.yml --json /path/to/project
```

**When to use:**
- Complex structural searches
- Relational rules (inside, has, precedes, follows)
- Composite logic (all, any, not)
- When you need the power of full YAML rules

**Tip:** For relational rules (inside/has), always add `stopBy: end` to ensure complete traversal.

## Tips for Writing Effective Rules

### Always Use stopBy: end

For relational rules, always use `stopBy: end` unless there's a specific reason not to:

```yaml
has:
  pattern: await $EXPR
  stopBy: end
```

This ensures the search traverses the entire subtree rather than stopping at the first non-matching node.

### Start Simple, Then Add Complexity

Begin with the simplest rule that could work:
1. Try a `pattern` first
2. If that doesn't work, try `kind` to match the node type
3. Add relational rules (`has`, `inside`) as needed
4. Combine with composite rules (`all`, `any`, `not`) for complex logic

### Use the Right Rule Type

- **Pattern**: For simple, direct code matching (e.g., `console.log($ARG)`)
- **Kind + Relational**: For complex structures (e.g., "function containing await")
- **Composite**: For logical combinations (e.g., "function with await but not in try-catch")

### Debug with AST Inspection

When rules don't match:
1. Use `--debug-query=cst` to see the actual AST structure
2. Check if metavariables are being detected correctly
3. Verify the node `kind` matches what you expect
4. Ensure relational rules are searching in the right direction

### Escaping in Inline Rules

When using `--inline-rules`, escape metavariables in shell commands:
- Use `\$VAR` instead of `$VAR` (shell interprets `$` as variable)
- Or use single quotes: `'$VAR'` works in most shells

**Example:**
```bash
# Correct: escaped $
ast-grep scan --inline-rules "rule: {pattern: 'console.log(\$ARG)'}" .

# Or use single quotes
ast-grep scan --inline-rules 'rule: {pattern: "console.log($ARG)"}' .
```

## Common Use Cases

### Find Functions with Specific Content

Find async functions that use await:
```bash
ast-grep scan --inline-rules "id: async-await
language: javascript
rule:
  all:
    - kind: function_declaration
    - has:
        pattern: await \$EXPR
        stopBy: end" /path/to/project
```

### Find Code Inside Specific Contexts

Find console.log inside class methods:
```bash
ast-grep scan --inline-rules "id: console-in-class
language: javascript
rule:
  pattern: console.log(\$\$\$)
  inside:
    kind: method_definition
    stopBy: end" /path/to/project
```

### Find Code Missing Expected Patterns

Find async functions without try-catch:
```bash
ast-grep scan --inline-rules "id: async-no-trycatch
language: javascript
rule:
  all:
    - kind: function_declaration
    - has:
        pattern: await \$EXPR
        stopBy: end
    - not:
        has:
          pattern: try { \$\$\$ } catch (\$E) { \$\$\$ }
          stopBy: end" /path/to/project
```

## Step 6: Verification (MANDATORY)

After searching the codebase, verify the complete workflow:

### Check 1: Rule Matches Example
- [ ] Rule matches the example code created in Step 2
- [ ] No false negatives on known examples

### Check 2: Results Are Valid
- [ ] Spot-check 3-5 results to confirm they match intent
- [ ] No obvious false positives

### Check 3: Edge Cases Covered
- [ ] Rule handles variations mentioned by user
- [ ] Nested cases handled (if applicable)

### Check 4: Rule Is Reproducible
- [ ] Rule can be re-run with same results
- [ ] Rule file or inline command documented for user

### Check 5: Results Reported
- [ ] Match count reported to user
- [ ] File paths and line numbers provided
- [ ] Example matches shown

**Gate:** Do NOT mark search complete until all 5 checks pass.

## Quality Checklist (Must Score 8/10)

Score yourself honestly before marking search complete:

### Query Understanding (0-2 points)
- **0 points:** Wrote rule without clarifying requirements
- **1 point:** Partial clarification (language or pattern, not both)
- **2 points:** Full clarification: pattern, language, edge cases, exclusions

### Example Code (0-2 points)
- **0 points:** No example code created
- **1 point:** Example code in memory only (not tested)
- **2 points:** Example code saved and verified with --debug-query

### Rule Quality (0-2 points)
- **0 points:** Rule doesn't compile or match anything
- **1 point:** Rule matches but missing stopBy: end on relational rules
- **2 points:** Rule is minimal, correct, uses stopBy: end where needed

### Testing (0-2 points)
- **0 points:** Searched codebase without testing
- **1 point:** Tested but didn't verify against example
- **2 points:** Tested against example with --stdin, verified matches

### Result Validation (0-2 points)
- **0 points:** Returned results without checking
- **1 point:** Checked count only
- **2 points:** Spot-checked results, confirmed they match intent

**Minimum passing score: 8/10**

## Common Rationalizations (All Wrong)

These are excuses. Don't fall for them:

- **"I know the AST structure"** → STILL use --debug-query=cst to verify
- **"It's a simple pattern"** → STILL test against example code first
- **"stopBy: end slows it down"** → STILL add it to relational rules (correctness > speed)
- **"The rule compiled"** → STILL verify it matches the example
- **"I'll check the results later"** → Spot-check NOW before returning them
- **"This is similar to a previous search"** → STILL write fresh example code
- **"The user knows what they want"** → STILL clarify language and edge cases
- **"Inline rules are harder"** → Learn to escape \$VAR properly, it's not optional

---

## Failure Modes

### Failure Mode 1: Missing stopBy: end
**Symptom:** Relational rule (inside/has) returns no matches even though they exist
**Fix:** Add `stopBy: end` to ensure search traverses the entire subtree

### Failure Mode 2: Wrong Node Kind
**Symptom:** Pattern doesn't match even though code looks correct
**Fix:** Use `--debug-query=cst` to find the actual kind name (e.g., `arrow_function` vs `function_declaration`)

### Failure Mode 3: Metavariable Not Detected
**Symptom:** `$VAR` appears literally in output instead of matching
**Fix:** Ensure metavariable is the only content in its AST node; use `--debug-query=pattern` to verify

### Failure Mode 4: Shell Escaping Issues
**Symptom:** Inline rule fails with "unexpected token" or empty results
**Fix:** Escape `$` as `\$` in double quotes, or use single quotes around the pattern

### Failure Mode 5: Wrong Language
**Symptom:** Rule matches nothing in a codebase that clearly has the pattern
**Fix:** Verify `--lang` flag matches file extension (e.g., `typescript` not `javascript` for `.tsx` files)

## Integration with Other Skills

The `ast-grep` skill integrates with:

- **`start`** — Use `start` to identify if ast-grep is the right tool for the search
- **`Grep` tool** — Use Grep for text search; use ast-grep for structural search
- **`Explore` agent** — Use Explore for broad discovery; use ast-grep for precise patterns

**When to use ast-grep vs Grep:**

| Scenario | Tool |
|----------|------|
| Find text "TODO" anywhere | Grep |
| Find function calls with specific structure | ast-grep |
| Find variable names matching regex | Grep |
| Find async functions without try-catch | ast-grep |
| Find imports from specific package | Either (ast-grep more precise) |
| Find code patterns across language constructs | ast-grep |

**Workflow Chain:**

```
User asks "find X"
       │
       ▼
Is X structural (AST-level)?
       │
  Yes──┼──No
       │     │
       ▼     ▼
  ast-grep  Grep/Explore
```

**Escalation Pattern:**

If ast-grep rule becomes too complex (5+ nested conditions), consider:
1. Breaking into multiple simpler searches
2. Using Explore agent for discovery first
3. Asking user to narrow the pattern
